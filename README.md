# Database Project

I had to design a database for a theater. In addition, I used SQL Server for the practical part

This project has the 3 following steps:
1. Design the ER model for this theater
2. Design the Relational model based on the ER model
3. Convert the Relational model to SQL code


##### Also, you can see the list of the [queries](https://github.com/MohammadHAbbaspour/DB_Project/blob/main/query.pdf) which I wrote for this database.
